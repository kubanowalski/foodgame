# About gierka test
This repository contains a project which I created with Antoni Janas (RzukLudojad) at AGH University of Science and Technology. 
The main idea of the project was to create a video game that was grounded in the kitchen setting. 
We prepared the game using Unreal Engine and assets found in Epic Store.
